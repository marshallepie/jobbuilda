# Root .env file for development (optional)
# This file documents common environment variables used across the project.
# Each app/service has its own .env or .env.local file.

# See individual .env.example files in:
# - apps/coordinator/.env.example
# - apps/admin/.env.local.example
# - apps/portal/.env.local.example
# - services/*-mcp/.env.example
# - infra/.env.example

# Quick Development Setup:
# All services are pre-configured with sensible defaults.
# Just run: pnpm dev:core

# For production, configure:
# 1. Supabase credentials (apps/admin/.env.local)
# 2. Database connection strings (services/*-mcp/.env)
# 3. NATS URL if not using local (all services)
# 4. JWT secret (coordinator and MCP services)
